meraki
======

Run script/danceparty_server.pl to test the application.

Meraki is a events manager website. It is geared to work as an events listing site, somewhat of a cross between Flavorpill and ReverbNation. It was written from scratch using the Perl Catalyst framework and integrates the Facebook Graph API. Currently the code is live at <a href="http://catalyst.complexconjugate.com">catalyst.complexconjugate.com</a>. I abandoned this project while waiting for my designer's work to come in, so it's got some pretty terrible UI. However the backend illustrates most of what I learned about perl/Catalyst during my time at <a href="http://www.socialflow.com">SocialFlow</a>.
